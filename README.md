# The World's Greatest To Do Application

I'm beginning learning iOS development. In the time-honored
tration of building a To Do application when learning technologies
for user interfaces, here's mine.

I wrote this after I've been studying iOS programming for a couple of weeks,
so do not judge the code too harshly or look to it as an example of how
to build a good application. I'm sure it's junk.

Here's some links to sites I found useful when buidling this:

The [Apple application development totorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training) was the first tutorial I
went through.

The [Logging in Swift](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2022/04/06/logging-in-swift/) article on the Swift with Majid blog helped me get started with using the logging framework.

The [Apple article on generating log messages](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging/generating_log_messages_from_your_code) helped flesh out the logging framework in more detail.

The [Develop in Swift Data Collections](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-data-collections/id1511183970) book is where I learned how to make a REST call. In my edition, this was lesson 2.4, *Working with the Web: HTTP and URL*.

The [Apple article on uploading data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system/uploading_data_to_a_website?language=objc)
was helpful when doing a POST request.

The [Apple Error protocol documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error).
